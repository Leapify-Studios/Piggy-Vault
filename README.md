# Piggy-Vault
This is a repository for the web app for Piggy Vault (Integrated Project)

**#Main idea**

This web app is for helping to manage their finances and saving money.

Users can manage their spendings and savings. They will be rewarded if they consistently update their money details and stay active. A mini gamification part is added into the website to keep Users hook onto managing their finances. When users earn achievement/ login daily, they gain piggy credits that can be used to gacha for piggy's.
Users can show off how great of an finances expert they are through climbing the top spot in the ranking system ,based on the amount of experience point by staying active and completing achievements.


*Worrying about how to be a pro at managing your finances? Fear not.*

Users can communicate on the forum page, to discuss and share about their money saving tips. 

Question can be

Eg. is there a good place to have my meal? I'm on a no spending week.



## Design Process
This website is for people who want to better manage their money and probably don't know how to start. This app is easy to use and can help users to manage their money wisely.
There's a saying in chinese 三分鐘熱度 (Sān fēn zhōng rè dù) which mean flash in the pan, something that happens once or for a short time and is not repeated. Some people do things but not consistently. They probably start today and stop 3 days later. 
However, piggy vault can make u hook onto it! As it has fetaures such as daily login with increasing rewards, limited items that keep you active. You probably don't wanna miss it. It's Fomo, I get it.
This is especially targeted at Free Spirit player type.

**Wireframes**



**Reason behind the design**


•  **Visuals**

Initially, we wanted to do pixel design. However, due to 3D models restrictions we decided to settle for something else. We decided to create a design that has 3D icons, with a clean minimalistic look. As I thought, you dont usually see icons that are in 3D, this is something special. The webite itself also looks like a phone design.

For the colour, I choose colour such as purple, black, grey and white. 

Purple is associated with luxury which is similar to money and finances. As in the past only people with higher status wears purple as Tyrian purple was made from the secretions of sea snails. It was very expensive and difficult to come by. 

White is often linked with cleanliness. Which is what i'm going for in the design.

Black is seen as formal. Which can be seen as profesionalism in the financial field.

Grey symbolizes neutrality and balance. This color can influence human behavior by conveying a sense of calm and understatement. Businesses often use gray in their branding and design to communicate professionalism and reliability. The gray in my design can serve as a neutral backdrop in design, allowing other colors to pop and draw attention without overwhelming the viewer. ( my 3D icons )


•  **Layout and Structure**

 The idea is to make the appearance look pop but not too messy with the combination of our 3D icons and the backdrop colours. 
 
 We have also carefully arranged our icons, images and box elements so that it doesn't messy and retain a clean look.

 As mentioned, the website is like a phone design with the top navigation bar and bottom navigation bar, we decided to go with this layout design as it is easier to navigate around. We also decided not to use the hamburger menu as, it is too generic and our features were just nice enough to fit into our design.
